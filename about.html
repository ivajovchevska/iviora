    <h1>About Iviora</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Iva Jovchevska, and I am a marketing specialist focused on creative strategy.
      Through Iviora, I work with brands and hotels to help them clarify their identity and
      translate that clarity into content, story, and expression that feels intentional,
      emotional, and aligned.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work sits between thinking and creating. I help brands define who they are, their values,
      positioning, and emotional direction, and then creatively transfer that identity into content
      that feels coherent, confident, and real.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe content should express something real. When identity is clear, expression becomes
      natural. Presence becomes calm, confident, and emotionally clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Iviora exists to help brands and hotels move from confusion to clarity, and from clarity to expression.
